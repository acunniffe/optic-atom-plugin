# Optic Atom Plugin
A lightweight plugin that allows you to use Atom &amp; Optic

## Install
1. Install the package to Atom
```bash
apm install optic
```

2. Open Optic. That's it, no keyboard shortcuts or views to worry about. This plugin will forward the state of Atom (current file, position and staged content) to Optic.
